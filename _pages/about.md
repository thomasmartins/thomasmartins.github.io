# Welcome!

Hi, Iâ€™m **Thomas Martins ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· / Martinez ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸**,
a quantitative risk analyst, economist and statistician with a strong background in **time series forecasting** and **financial econometrics**.

## ðŸ§° Risk Management Tools

I build full-stack, production-grade tools for risk analytics and supervisory reporting, combining end-to-end data pipelines, probabilistic programming and economic models to deliver reproducible and interpretable outputs for regulatory metrics and risk management.

My portfolio includes three projects that demonstrate my ability to build data pipelines, deploy interactive dashboards, and integrate quantitative methods in a modern risk infrastructure:

- **Basel III Risk Data Pipeline & Interactive Dashboard**

An end-to-end platform for Basel III liquidity, capital, and IRRBB metrics, including PostgreSQL schema design, SQLAlchemy integration, and Streamlit dashboard deployment.
[**Live App**](https://basel-risk-pipeline-tmartins.streamlit.app/) | [**GitHub**](https://github.com/thomasmartins/basel-risk-pipeline) | [**Blog**](https://thomasmartins.github.io/posts/risk-dashboard/)

- **Bayesian Forecasting of IRRBB with SVARs** (upcoming)
- **Capital Optimization with Reinforcement Learning** (upcoming)

## ðŸŽ“ Research and Writing

Alongside my professional activities, my research interests include:

- **Macrofinance**
- **Fiscal-monetary policy interactions**
- **Bayesian macroeconometrics**
- The **macroeconomic consequences of demographic change**

Iâ€™m passionate about using **Bayesian methods** and **structural modeling** to answer complex economic questions at the intersection of statistics, finance and macroeconomics.
